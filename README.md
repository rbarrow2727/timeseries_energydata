Time Series Analysis of Residential Energy Consumption

A look into a time-series data of 3 residential sub-meters to determine if a home developer chooses to install Smart Home hardware, providing owners with data on energy use


- What data visualizations can be created to empower Smart Home owners to understand and control their power usage?
- Enable owners to not only understand the data given, but give them the means to apply it to their home and use every day
- Educating owners on best practices for efficiency and savings
- Teach users that it doesnâ€™t require a lot of technical expertise to reduce carbon footprint, share data across other smart devices, and empower others to positively affect their environment and financial goals

- Data pertaining to the kitchen and laundry room sub-meters are tough to glean any valuable insight.  We see in the smoothing plots that the erratic energy usage comes from running the larger appliances, dishwasher in the kitchen, washer/dryer in the laundry, etc. The smoothing helps find a nice average used to conservatively forecast energy usage. The forecasted time series does a better job trying to predict the more erratic behavior, however it is still difficult to predict when those appliances are going to run regardless of season, month, or time of day. 
- The smoothing analysis on sub-meter 3 (water heater/AC) I found to be much more useful.  The higher coefficient means more energy was consumed with this sub-meter but also predicts a value with not as many of the random high surges found in the other two sub-meters.  This submeter is more consistent in its energy usage make the insights more applicable to real-world scenarios.  
- There is a relevant seasonal pattern with the water heater/AC submeter in the late spring as well, shown in slide 9.  More energy was consumed with the colder months started to fade and the warmer months began.  
- The future use of the sub-meter 3 is expected to increase compared to the other two sub-meters which have a downward trend. 
- This allows an opportunity to help conserve energy by recommending better practices in managing the appliances in sub-meter 3 (next slide)
